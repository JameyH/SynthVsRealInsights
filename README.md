Synthetic vs Real-World Data
CS7646 at Georgia Tech - Personal Repository

Personal repository for CS7646 Machine Learning class at Georgia Tech. This repository is dedicated to exploring and comparing the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms on synthetic versus real-world datasets. The primary focus is to understand how different data sources impact the performance of these algorithms.

Jupyter Notebooks: All code and analysis are presented in Jupyter notebooks for quick iterations
Datasets: This folder contains both synthetic and real-world datasets used in the experiments.
Algorithm Analysis: a variety of machine learning algorithms to assess their strengths and weaknesses.
